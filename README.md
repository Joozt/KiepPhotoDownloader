# KiepPhotoDownloader
### A C# console application for downloading photos from Gmail via IMAP

The credentials have to be entered in [Program.cs](Program.cs). The application can be limited by number of days.

The tool is used together with a [Tobii Dynavox Communicator](http://www.tobiidynavox.com/) e-mail page set that displays the local picture library.

See [KiepProjects](https://github.com/Joozt/KiepProjects) for an overview of all Kiep projects.
